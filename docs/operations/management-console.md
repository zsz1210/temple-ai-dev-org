# Optional Management Console

Temple does not require a browser interface. Work Items, lifecycle gates, evidence, collaboration, context routing, and verification remain available through Temple Core when this process is never started.

Use the Management Console when a person wants a read-only browser view of current repository state and retained local telemetry. Starting it does not connect Codex, collect new Token data, acquire the telemetry writer lease, install a service, or enable the Human Inbox and Agent Commands.

## Start only when needed

From an initialized project:

```bash
node ./templew.mjs console start .
```

The command prints a loopback URL and runs until `Ctrl-C`. The page identifies itself as `Local · Read only`.

For one exact trusted home-LAN address:

```bash
TEMPLE_LAN_IP="$(ipconfig getifaddr en1)"
node ./templew.mjs console start . \
  --lan-viewer-host "$TEMPLE_LAN_IP" \
  --lan-viewer-port 41741
```

The LAN listener remains GET-only and uses the existing private-viewer redaction boundary. It does not turn the loopback listener into a network command gateway. Tailscale viewing is also an explicit Console option:

```bash
node ./templew.mjs console start . --tailscale-viewer
```

Neither private-viewer option starts Usage collection.

## What updates the page

The Console reads canonical `.ai-org/` state and retained telemetry only when a browser requests a snapshot. It watches bounded project-state and telemetry directories for file changes, invalidates its cached snapshot, and sends a refresh signal to connected pages. It does not run the Control Plane's 750 ms repository polling loop.

An unchanged cached snapshot is reused for at most 30 seconds. A changed file causes the next browser request to rebuild it. This removes idle background scanning; it does not claim that rebuilding a large retained Usage history is free. WI-0094 retains that separate performance question.

## Run it with or without collection

The Console opens telemetry read-only and never acquires the writer lease. A separate Collector can therefore run at the same time:

```bash
# Terminal 1: optional human view
node ./templew.mjs console start .

# Terminal 2: optional on-demand Token collection
node ./templew.mjs usage collect .
```

Stopping either process does not stop Temple Core or delete retained telemetry. If the Collector is off, new task-level Usage remains unknown; the Console continues to show canonical project state and prior observations.

## Read-only route boundary

The optional Console exposes only:

- `GET /` — the human-facing Management Console;
- `GET /healthz` — optional-process health and authority facts;
- `GET /api/v1/snapshot` — a path-redacted read-only snapshot;
- `GET /api/v1/events` — refresh notifications without raw journal events.
- `GET /api/v1/work-items/<Work Item ID>/delivery` — local-only bounded recorded
  delivery summary. Private network viewers receive `403` for this additional detail.

Every non-GET request returns `405`. The Console snapshot excludes the local daemon record, Human Inbox, raw recent events, and telemetry state-directory path.

## Recorded delivery detail

In **Work**, choose Open, Closed, or All Work Items, then select a row. Open remains
the default. The detail reads one Work Item and its common-entry session on demand;
it does not scan every delivery history during snapshot generation. Both the
optional Console and combined operator dashboard use the same projection.

Canonical lifecycle/outcome and common-session completion are separate. A Done
Work Item can have an incomplete common session. Until that session completes,
elapsed counters run through the displayed observation time, including time after
canonical closure; they are not a completed delivery duration. No session record
does not prove which execution path was used. Invalid records remain unavailable.

The panel shows candidate/tested revision, the latest five recorded checks, up to
three references per evidence category, time counters, repairs, pauses and pending
operation names. References are not revalidated, and these checks are not the full
project test inventory. Lean review does not imply formal Independent QA.
Task Operational Tokens remain unknown without complete observations; known
observed tokens are input minus cached input plus output, not money. Zero observed
calls does not mean no AI use. The endpoint exposes no raw pending requests,
usage receipts or evidence contents and performs no model calls or mutations.

A browser retains at most 32 summaries, reuses them for 30 seconds, and refreshes
an expired selected summary on a subsequent render. Use **Refresh delivery
summary** to read immediately. Loading, request failure/retry, missing and invalid
records are separate states; switching selection cannot apply an old response to
the newly selected item. Private viewers retain the existing snapshot boundary.

## Legacy combined operator path

`temple control-plane start` remains available during the current Alpha for existing workflows that intentionally combine the browser, repository provider, telemetry writer, and optional command gateway. It is not the recommended way to obtain a read-only project overview. See [Legacy combined control plane](control-plane.md) for that larger authority surface and [Usage observation](usage-observation.md) for collection choices.
