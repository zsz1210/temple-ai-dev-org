# Native dispatch and model selection

The main conversation keeps the user's selected model. Newly delegated operations
get explicit selections, bounded scopes and generated execution IDs. Nicknames are
optional. Registered actors remain accountability keys, separate from models.

## Project policy

Save the reviewed policy and include its path in a new task brief's
`environment.data.policy_refs`. Approval pins exact bytes; existing contracts cannot
acquire a changed policy by editing a file afterward.

```json
{
  "schema_version":"workkeel.dispatch-policy/v1",
  "models":[
    {"alias":"small","provider":"local","model":"your-small-model","reasoning":null,"data_classes":["public","internal"]},
    {"alias":"review","provider":"your-provider","model":"your-reviewed-model","reasoning":"high","data_classes":["public","internal"]}
  ],
  "default_alias":"small","conservative_alias":"review","parallelism":2
}
```

Names above are placeholders. Use models approved and actually supported by the
host. There is no framework default vendor, paid API requirement or universal
reasoning scale. Host capabilities and permitted data classes must match.

## Dispatch sequence

1. Claim the task. Split work into nodes with `id`, `activity_kind`, `depends_on`,
   `read_paths` and `write_paths`. Kinds are `planning`, `implementation`, `review`,
   `repair`, `verification`. Review nodes are read-only.
2. `dispatch plan` takes `{policy,plan:{nodes,completed,running}}`. Its ready group
   respects dependencies, read/write conflicts and parallel limits. Record actual
   completion before requesting the next group. Planning does not launch a model.
3. `dispatch prepare` takes `operation_id`, `task_id`, `actor`, `claim_id`,
   `contract_sha256`, pinned `policy_ref`, `node`, `capabilities`, and optional
   `route`/`display_label`. Identical retries return the original UUID; conflicting
   retries stop. Keep the operation ID stable after an uncertain result.
4. Pass the ticket's `selected.model` and `selected.reasoning` explicitly to the
   host's agent-start tool with only necessary context and approved scope. If the
   host cannot select that tuple, report the mismatch; never silently inherit the
   coordinator model. The host still enforces filesystem, tools and networking.
5. Before product work, use the [capture helper](workkeel-native-usage.md#capture-an-operation-from-start-to-finish)
   to bind the returned exact thread/turn and start its activity clock. Hosts that
   already measure intervals can use `dispatch bind` with `{execution_id,source}`.
   Binding rechecks active dependency/conflict limits. A local runner or
   other host uses `source.kind:"host-report"`; the optional Codex reader uses an
   explicitly selected rollout path. No unrelated conversations are discovered.
6. Finish the capture and inspect its receipt, or report the host's own usage and
   actual intervals. Retry collection after a late host completion row without
   restarting the clock. Pause while awaiting a person. The coordinator
   must not count idle waiting for a child as its own work. Preserve unknown data.
7. An actual different Agent reviews the exact candidate and records the ordinary
   lifecycle review. Prepare/bind its operation before handoff; existing bindings
   may finish afterward. A new binding after handoff is not authorized by the old
   implementation claim. A generated ID alone does not prove independence.

The source-checkout [delivery helper](#compact-resumption-and-execution-receipts) provides `context`,
`guide`, `prepare`, `attach`, `finish`, `check` and `review` commands over these existing APIs. It fills immutable ticket
identity fields when reporting, preserves explicit host measurements and returns
a compact receipt with missing fields. It does not start or schedule an Agent.
Use one operation per activity kind; a review or repair needs its own prepared
ticket and exact host binding. Report completion before releasing or closing the
task, and inspect the receipt instead of treating a successful host turn as proof
that usage was captured.

Prepare the bounded review packet when the candidate and relevant checks are
ready. It should identify the exact revision, changed paths, acceptance, completed
checks and unresolved issues. Let independent verification commands retain their
own output; the reviewer need not repeatedly reload progress while waiting.
One final behavioral candidate still needs the complete verification gate.

```sh
workkeel dispatch plan . --request plan.json
workkeel dispatch prepare . --request dispatch.json
workkeel dispatch show . --id <returned-execution-id>
workkeel dispatch bind . --request binding.json
workkeel usage report . --request result.json
workkeel usage activity . --request intervals.json
```

Capabilities have shape `{host,models:[{provider,model,reasoning:["high",null]}]}`.
`route.alias` chooses an approved model. Eligible local classifier advice chooses
its approved alias; ineligible advice and `route.risk:"high"` use the conservative
alias. Classifier metadata is `{alias,eligible,name,tier,selection_reason,model_called:false}`
under `route.classifier`. Complexity scores are not confidence probabilities.

## Existing personal LiteLLM selector

The source-checkout helper connects the already installed selector:

```sh
node scripts/prepare-workkeel-dispatch.mjs /absolute/project /absolute/request.json /absolute/personal-tool/route.mjs /absolute/private/machine.json
```

The request is `{dispatch:<prepare request>,prompt:<bounded description>,profile:"auto"}`.
Profiles are `auto`, `bounded-low-risk` and `review`. The helper maps the guarded
result to one unique approved model alias and saves selection metadata, not the
prompt. It explicitly imports a trusted local module exporting
`preview(prompt,{profile,config})`; review that executable module before use.
This helper is not a sandbox for arbitrary plugins.

The existing personal selector uses LiteLLM 1.101.0's network-disabled local heuristic
and conservative guards. It calls neither a classifier model nor LiteLLM Proxy.
The helper installs and vendors nothing, leaves the original personal tool intact,
and changes no account or global model settings. Other local classifiers may
implement the same interface. Execution through a gateway is a separate choice.

## Records and limits

Immutable tickets are ignored project-local intent records under `.ai-org/dispatch`,
bounded to 1,024 entries. A ticket does not prove execution. Usage bindings record
the exact host source, selected/reported model and activity kind. Export deliberately;
the observer serves no raw prompt, private source path or credential.

Usage analysis sums operation durations; task execution time takes their interval
union. Parallel operations can overlap, including across kinds. Explicit activity
labels take precedence over old lifecycle attribution. Unknown, partial and measured
zero remain distinct. See [native reporting](workkeel-native-usage.md).

Hosts must actually consume tickets and report execution. Workkeel cannot intercept
arbitrary desktop tool calls. Repository instructions require this path for new
approved delegation; unsupported hosts expose their selection or reporting gap.

### Retained claim evidence

Some older cancellations removed the active claim ID. A historical dispatch then
remains unavailable unless an operator explicitly retains the original task body
at `.ai-org/artifacts/<task-id>/dispatch-claim-<claim-event-hash>.json`.
The reader uses the normal task validator and requires the exact task version,
contract, actor, claim ID and complete history prefix. The last event's body hash
must match the snapshot and the current canonical chain. A copied ticket or a
reconstructed claim ID is insufficient. Missing, changed, oversized or symlinked
proofs fail closed. Readers do not scan Git or conversations to find a snapshot.

This restores access to existing measurements only. It neither revives a claim
nor permits new execution, rewrites task/ticket history, invents measurements or
accepts a delivery. Preserve the exact snapshot bytes and review the source before
retaining it; live execution still requires the current approved claim.

This repository's own [development policy](../policies/development-dispatch.json)
retains the approved personal Luna/Sol medium choices and at most three workers.
It is project configuration, not a provider restriction imposed on other projects.

## Compact resumption and execution receipts

These optional source-checkout helpers reuse the native task, dispatch and usage
APIs. They require no new dependency, service, provider or model call. They reduce
repeated task-history output and repeated entry of ticket identity fields. The
execution host still starts Agents and supplies its own measurements.

### Delivery evidence preflight and report

Before handing off, recording review, or closing, inspect the exact pending
operation's candidate files. Save an input containing `task_id`, `action`
(`handoff`, `review`, or `close`) and `request` (the complete pending native
operation request, including the exact candidate and evidence paths):

```sh
node /path/to/workkeel/scripts/workkeel-delivery-preflight.mjs candidate /absolute/project /private/candidate-request.json
```

This read-only command shares file classification with the lifecycle writer.
`candidate_files_passed` describes files only, not permission, verification or
review. It identifies out-of-scope committed changes, product drift, unlisted
reports and changes to already tracked candidate artifacts. Output is bounded;
`truncated` and counts identify omitted rows. The actual operation still rechecks
the current claim, authority, version, dependencies, evidence and separation.

Prepare analysis programs and delivery documents before the verified candidate.
Later local analysis programs belong in ignored output; their report files may
be named explicitly as new administrative evidence. Do not rename code as a report
to bypass the product gate. A new snapshot needs its own evidence path; listing an
old tracked report never permits changing its bytes. Preserve existing pinned
reports and save late measurements under new names.

The optional source-checkout command reads existing task-bound receipts and an
explicit list of evidence files. It does not collect sessions, call models or
perform lifecycle transitions. Use it to prepare delivery documents before the
final candidate checks, then repeat the evidence check against the committed
candidate before handoff.

```json
{
  "task_id":"WK-example",
  "expected":[
    {"label":"implementation","activity_kind":"implementation",
     "binding":{"kind":"dispatch","id":"<prepared UUID>"}}
  ],
  "candidate_revision":"<exact 40-character commit>",
  "evidence":[".ai-org/artifacts/WK-example/approval.md"]
}
```

```sh
node /path/to/workkeel/scripts/workkeel-delivery-preflight.mjs check /absolute/project /private/preflight.json
node /path/to/workkeel/scripts/workkeel-delivery-preflight.mjs report /absolute/project /private/preflight.json
```

Both commands write to stdout only. `check` produces JSON; `report` produces an
English Markdown table. They return a nonzero exit status when evidence preflight
fails. Evidence must be bounded regular files, match the exact current Git
candidate and pass the same documentation language policy as repository checks.
Untracked files, changed bytes, symlinks, stale candidates and invalid authority
evidence remain visible as failures. A localization-looking filename alone does
not exempt a document from the repository language policy.

If a generated report is part of candidate evidence, save it before final
verification and check it with the other documents. Later measurement snapshots
belong outside the candidate or in the existing ignored private capture directory;
do not rewrite pinned evidence or create unlisted files during review. The report
describes the supplied candidate and measurement snapshot, not a future revision
containing the report.

Totals add only known values from declared operations. Unknown is different from
zero; partial subtotals include their coverage. Cached input is already included
in input and is never added to it again. Summed operation time includes parallel
work and is not elapsed task time. A completed expected list cannot establish
that every task operation was declared. The main conversation may still have an
uncollected tail at the time of a snapshot.

`evidence_preflight_passed` concerns only these evidence checks. Full verification
and independent review remain unperformed by this command, even when a file is
named `verification.md` or contains a passing claim. Run the applicable gate on
the exact candidate, preserve its actual output, and have the distinct reviewer
record the normal native review. This command grants no execution or acceptance
authority and does not replace native lifecycle guards.

### Resume from current facts

```sh
node /path/to/workkeel/scripts/workkeel-delivery.mjs context /absolute/project WK-example
```

Read the current goal, state, scope, acceptance, next action, candidate, attention
reasons and evidence references first. Required project instructions still apply.
The view does not include the entire event timeline or evidence bodies. Open a
referenced source when needed; use `workkeel task summary` for the complete view.
Neither command claims work, revives an ended claim, verifies a running process
or authorizes implementation. Evidence and authority warnings remain visible.

Keep one approved delivery in one native task. Use dispatch nodes to divide
implementation, review, repair and verification. Before claiming, check shared
files and candidate integration, approval text, versions and publication needs.
If the actual scope changes, preserve the earlier contract and obtain appropriate
authority. Do not create replacement tasks solely to rename a node or continue
the same approved implementation.

### Prepare a lifecycle request

From a reviewed source checkout, start with:

```sh
node /path/to/workkeel/scripts/workkeel-delivery.mjs guide /absolute/project WK-example
```

This read-only response combines the compact context with the current operation's
required fields and one instruction. Scope, acceptance and evidence warnings remain
complete. Read required project instructions, the approved contract and relevant
evidence; load the detailed operation reference when a question remains. The helper
is source-checkout tooling, not a new installed CLI command or bundled npm script.

The same helper prepares mechanical fields without changing task state. Save an
input with actual decisions, for example a completed handoff:

```json
{
  "task_id":"WK-example",
  "action":"handoff",
  "actor":{"agent_id":"builder","principal_id":"owner"},
  "operation_id":"handoff-1",
  "summary":"Describe the actual changes and completed checks",
  "evidence":[".ai-org/artifacts/WK-example/developer.md"],
  "unresolved":[]
}
```

```sh
node /path/to/workkeel/scripts/workkeel-delivery.mjs prepare /absolute/project /private/decision.json > /private/prepared.json
```

Inspect the returned `request`, including its exact revision. Save only that field
as a task-local request file, then use the existing pinned native command:

```sh
workkeel task handoff . --id WK-example --request .ai-org/artifacts/WK-example/handoff.json
```

| Action | Caller supplies, in addition to task, action, actor and operation ID | Derived fields |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `claim` | No decision fields | Current task version and Git HEAD |
| `handoff` | Actual summary, evidence and explicit empty unresolved list | Current version, claim ID and Git HEAD |
| `review` | Actual review judgment, summary and evidence | Current version and delivered revision |
| `close` | Actual acceptance summary, rollback and evidence | Current version and delivered revision |

Preparation neither runs checks nor validates all candidate/evidence conditions.
`validation_status: native-apply-required` means the ordinary native command must
still check authority, dependencies, version, candidate, scope, evidence and reviewer
separation. Input cannot override derived fields. No verdict, summary, evidence,
actor or operation ID is invented. A distinct actual reviewer still owns review;
preparing a request does not make the caller independent or grant acceptance authority.

Save requests before applying. After an uncertain write, inspect history and replay
the identical saved request. Preparation refuses already-recorded operation IDs;
it must not silently refresh a stale request or change its meaning on retry. A
failed review needs the existing explicit rework path. Cancellation and release
also retain their existing native commands. No new model, network call or lifecycle
mutation is performed by `guide` or `prepare`.

### Attach the exact execution

Prepare a dispatch ticket using the [native dispatch sequence](workkeel-native-dispatch.md),
start the selected runtime, and save its exact source in a private request file.
The attach request is the existing `dispatch bind` request:

```json
{
  "execution_id": "<prepared UUID>",
  "source": {"kind":"host-report","thread_id":"actual-host-session","turn_id":"actual-operation"},
  "sample_kind": "real-task"
}
```

```sh
node /path/to/workkeel/scripts/workkeel-delivery.mjs attach /absolute/project /private/attach.json
```

The optional Codex reader accepts its existing exact rollout path/thread/turn
source instead. Preserve the explicit approval requirement for capture from the
start of a turn. Do not search unrelated conversations or store source paths in
public delivery evidence. Source checks, dispatch limits and claim guards remain
those of the existing binding API.

### Finish a host report

Use the same execution ID and a stable report ID on retries. The `report` object
uses the existing host-report fields; ticket identity and activity kind come from
the verified ticket. This example describes an actually model-free verification
command. Use actual model metadata and usage for model execution; unknown fields
must not be filled with zero or requested model values.

```json
{
  "execution_id": "<prepared UUID>",
  "report": {
    "report_id": "verification-result-1",
    "status": "completed",
    "usage": {"input_tokens":0,"output_tokens":0},
    "tool": "node",
    "provider": "local",
    "model": null,
    "reported_reasoning": null,
    "sample_kind": "real-task",
    "observed_at": "<actual ISO timestamp>"
  }
}
```

```sh
node /path/to/workkeel/scripts/workkeel-delivery.mjs finish /absolute/project /private/result.json
```

When the host can measure activity excluding waiting, supply
`execution_duration_ms` and `execution_intervals` with actual start/end times.
Intervals are cumulative assertions validated by the existing API. Omitting them
leaves activity unknown. Never copy full-turn duration into activity merely to
make a chart complete. Keep separate operations for implementation, review and
repair rather than relabeling a previous operation.

### Collect an already attached source

```json
{"execution_id":"<prepared UUID>","collect":true}
```

An optional `activity` object contains `report_id`, `observed_at`,
`execution_duration_ms` and `execution_intervals`. It must describe actual
wait-excluded work and pass the same cumulative-interval guards. No timestamp is
derived from task state, the current clock or a full-turn duration.

`report` and `collect` are alternative modes. Wrong-source requests are refused.
The helper does not close collection or mark a still-running source completed.
Collection and activity reporting use existing sequential operations, not a new
transaction. If collection reports a source problem, inspect the receipt and retry
the same valid report; a successful activity write alone does not prove complete
usage collection. The existing replay guard prevents a report from being counted
twice and rejects changed content under the same report ID.

### Read the receipt and stop at the right boundary

The compact receipt shows actual reported model and usage, recorded activity,
separate host turn duration when available, source state and missing fields.
Missing and measured zero remain different. A completed operation does not prove
complete task coverage. Unsupported hosts must expose their reporting gap.

Complete available reports before release, rework, cancellation or task close.
If the host writes its terminal row only after the reporting turn ends, explicitly
retain the pending binding for later collection and disclose the gap in closeout.
Do not mark the source completed or infer activity to make a report look final. Existing
pre-bound reporting across handoff retains its validated authority; a convenience
helper does not create a new implementation claim or authorize a new binding.
Independent review and local acceptance remain separate lifecycle commands.

### Check expected operations before handoff and closeout

Keep an explicit, task-local list of expected operations. Include the coordinator
and each implementation, repair, review or verification operation that actually
takes place. Declare an unbound operation with `binding:null`; do not omit it to
make coverage look complete. A host binding supports the coordinator without
changing the main conversation's model. Dispatch bindings use the prepared UUID.

```json
{
  "task_id":"WK-example",
  "expected":[
    {"label":"coordinator","activity_kind":"planning","binding":{"kind":"host","id":"coordinator-binding"}},
    {"label":"implementation","activity_kind":"implementation","binding":{"kind":"dispatch","id":"<prepared UUID>"}},
    {"label":"repair","activity_kind":"repair","binding":null}
  ]
}
```

```sh
node /path/to/workkeel/scripts/workkeel-delivery.mjs check /absolute/project /private/expected.json
```

Before handoff, check `bindings_ready`, especially for the reviewer: new bindings
require the active build claim. After executions finish, run their reports and
check `declared_reports_complete` before local acceptance. Each row distinguishes
missing binding, unavailable record, incomplete report and reported operation.
Completion here requires an observed source, a completed operation, active time,
input tokens and output tokens. Other token counters and model fields stay visible
as missing when unavailable; measured zero is valid. This is a reporting check,
not a replacement for task authority or a mandatory acceptance gate.

The same check also exposes `task_state`, `task_locally_accepted` and `collection`.
These answer separate questions: was the task accepted, have the declared sources
reached an observed terminal outcome, and are the required measurements present?
`collection.status` is `completed`, `pending`, `stopped` or `unavailable`;
its counts retain missing bindings and its follow-up list identifies unresolved
operations. A terminal interrupted operation can finish collection without being
a successful execution. An explicit stop does not certify final source coverage.
Unavailable or mismatched bindings and inventory errors prevent collection from
being summarized as complete. Existing report-completeness requirements stay unchanged.

Each receipt includes `cutoffs.usage_observed_at`, `activity_ended_at` and
`collected_at`. The first requires an observed token counter, the second comes
only from recorded execution intervals, and the third is the collector's timestamp.
`usage_observed_after_activity` is null if either cutoff is unknown. True means
the usage observation is later; it cannot distinguish late recording from unmeasured
work and does not authorize extending activity time or calculating tokens per second.
The Markdown preflight report shows these cutoffs and follow-up actions together.
Checks read existing sanitized records without opening raw execution sources or
changing the task. Collect a pending source explicitly, then rerun the same check.

`task_coverage_complete` always remains false. The list is caller-declared and
cannot prove that no work was omitted. `unlisted_binding_count` exposes additional
recorded operations in this task, while corrupt project inventory stays explicit.
No unrelated conversation is searched and no source is collected by this check.
Missing history stays unknown. Add a repair operation when repair begins; do not
invent one with zero time just because no repair was recorded.

### Review and record in one actual reviewer turn

Prepare the exact candidate, verification evidence and a bounded review packet
before starting the distinct reviewer. Prepare its ticket and bind the actual
turn while the build claim is active, then hand off that candidate. Pass the
reviewer the task ID, execution ID, candidate and evidence paths. The reviewer
can obtain the packet after handoff:

```json
{
  "task_id":"WK-example",
  "execution_id":"<pre-bound review UUID>",
  "reviewer":{"agent_id":"reviewer","principal_id":"owner"}
}
```

```sh
node /path/to/workkeel/scripts/workkeel-delivery.mjs review /absolute/project /private/review-packet.json
```

The packet contains changed paths, acceptance criteria, evidence references and
a request template with the exact delivered revision and current task version.
Judgment, summary, evidence and operation ID are deliberately unset: the actual
reviewer supplies them after inspecting the candidate. It then records `task
review` in that same turn. Do not spawn another turn solely to copy a verdict.
A failure is recorded as a failure and follows the ordinary rework path.

The packet requires the current delivery's pre-bound review ticket and a
registered reviewer satisfying separation. It grants no authority and does not
verify product changes; the native review command still checks drift, evidence,
dependencies, current approval and identity. Finish that review's usage report
before the authorized coordinator records local acceptance.

For future real product work, record the same fields and review/repair outcomes.
Do not invent an unrelated product task or model benchmark to fill the dashboard.
Compare only compatible recorded scopes; publishing, user waiting and unmeasured
work must remain explicit. This helper does not alter the observer UI or learning
promotion rules.
