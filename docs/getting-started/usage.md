# Usage guide

This is the complete reference. If this is your first Work Item, follow the shorter [Temple Core Path](core-path.md) from initialization through closeout, then return here for advanced and alternative operations.

## 1. Install the central framework

```bash
git clone git@github.com:zsz1210/temple-ai-dev-org.git
cd temple-ai-dev-org
npm ci
npm run verify
# Optional: expose the local CLI as `temple`
npm link
temple --version
```

Clone the central framework once and install its exact lockfile dependencies with `npm ci`. Install it into each product repository with `temple init`; no fork is required. `project-overlay/` is only the installation source inside the central repository. Its contents are installed directly at the product repository root.

## 2. First initialization

### Recommended: use Codex assistance

For the first run, open Codex in the central framework repository and provide the absolute path to the target repository:

> Use temple-init with `/absolute/path/to/target`. Inspect its existing branch, review, and integration policy first; ask only about missing choices that affect execution. Then suggest English names for the five Assignment slots, show me the Position mapping and integration summary, wait for my confirmation, and initialize the project.

The AI first inspects repository-local evidence such as `CONTRIBUTING.md`, governance or delivery documentation, CI configuration, and Git state. If those sources already define the workflow, the AI summarizes and cites them instead of asking the user to restate the rules. If an execution-relevant choice remains unclear, it asks only for that missing choice. The pre-write proposal combines the workflow summary, Position mappings, and names; the AI may create the configuration and run `init` only after confirmation.

After installation, the target repository receives `$temple-init`, `$temple-work`, `$decision-interview`, `$domain-modeling`, `$project-documentation`, and `$skill-authoring`. The central repository itself contains no default names or required Git workflow. The target's existing GitHub, GitLab, or company policy remains authoritative, and Temple does not contact the provider or change its settings during initialization.

### Manual configuration

Start with the package-visible [minimal configuration](temple-init.example.json). From the Temple source or unpacked package root:

```bash
cp docs/getting-started/temple-init.example.json /tmp/temple-init.json
```

Edit the project ID, project name, and five English display names. Keep every Position assigned and keep Developer separate from Independent QA. The example intentionally omits `repository_integration`; Temple will write an honest `unconfirmed` record instead of making the user or Agent guess a branch, review, or integration policy.

Preview and apply it to the target repository:

```bash
temple init /absolute/path/to/target --config /tmp/temple-init.json --dry-run
temple init /absolute/path/to/target --config /tmp/temple-init.json
```

Add `repository_integration` only after its source has actually been inspected or confirmed. Its `source` accepts exactly these values:

| `source` | Use it when |
| --- | --- |
| `not-inspected` | No policy source has been inspected. This is valid only with `status: "unconfirmed"` and is the default when the field is omitted. |
| `repository-policy` | Repository files such as `CONTRIBUTING.md` define the integration policy. Cite them in `policy_refs`. |
| `human-confirmed` | A Human Principal explicitly supplied or confirmed the integration decision. |

For example, append this object only when the cited repository policy was reviewed:

```json
{
  "repository_integration": {
    "schema_version": "temple.repository-integration/v1",
    "status": "confirmed",
    "authority": "project",
    "source": "repository-policy",
    "policy_refs": ["CONTRIBUTING.md"],
    "summary": "Use short-lived branches and review changes before integrating them.",
    "integration_target": "main",
    "change_isolation": "required",
    "review_gate": "required",
    "recorded_at": "2026-09-02T00:00:00.000Z",
    "recorded_by": "human"
  }
}
```

This object describes one project; it is not Temple's default workflow. `policy_refs` points to the authoritative repository documents, while `summary` gives Agents a short routing hint. Use `deferred` only when the user intentionally postpones the choice and the summary states when it must be revisited.

After a successful init, the CLI prints directly copyable `doctor` and `status` commands through the target repository's `templew.mjs` launcher. It also emits the versioned `TEMPLE_BOOTSTRAP_REQUIRED` result described below. Pass `--json` when another program needs one parseable `temple.init-result/v1` document instead of the human plan and report. The launcher reads `temple.cli-bootstrap/v1` from `temple.lock`, pins the installed framework version, and rejects a development override with a different version. An ordinary project recovers the CLI from the exact Git revision recorded by a clean framework source or from the version-pinned package source. It does not depend on a Temple source checkout beside the project.

### When an Agent runs init inside an existing session

Creating repository instructions does not prove that the Agent's current session loaded them. The successful init result therefore reports `temple.bootstrap-required/v1` and offers two paths:

1. **Fresh session — recommended.** Resolve any reported `AGENTS.md` or provider-entrypoint merge first, end the current session, start a fresh session rooted at the initialized repository, and use the provider's own context inspection to confirm what it loaded.
2. **Explicit read — supported.** Read every source named by the result, run the copyable Doctor command and read-only Status command, identify or create one durable Work Item through the normal lifecycle, run the provided Context command template with that Work Item and Position, then report the Position, Agent Identity, Work Item ID, and next canonical action before mutation.

Provider entrypoints and session continuity are separate concerns. The CLI installs `AGENTS.md` as the canonical root Agent instruction and, for [Claude Code's documented project memory entrypoint](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory#agentsmd), creates a project-owned `CLAUDE.md` containing only `@AGENTS.md` when that path is absent. The import avoids copying the organization rules and works without symlinks. The bootstrap result reports the documented adapter contract as available, but keeps `session_loading_verified` and `comprehension_verified` false. A fresh session still needs provider-owned confirmation; another Agent platform still needs its own supported entrypoint.

If the target already had an unrelated `AGENTS.md` and init reports `pending_merge`, `.ai-org/project/AGENTS.temple.md` contains the preserved Temple block. A fresh session alone cannot activate that unmerged block. Review and integrate it before relying on session-start loading.

Root `CLAUDE.md` is also project-owned. If it already contains a standalone `@AGENTS.md` or `@./AGENTS.md` import, init preserves it byte-for-byte and reports `present`. If it does not, init preserves the file and writes the proposed one-line import to `.ai-org/project/CLAUDE.temple.md`; `claude_integration` remains `pending_merge` until a human-approved integration is complete. A fresh session alone cannot repair that pending provider entrypoint. The CLI never appends to or overwrites an existing `CLAUDE.md`, and neither Claude file becomes a framework-managed lock entry.

Dry-run, planning conflicts, failed initialization, and an unhealthy post-init Doctor do not emit a completed bootstrap requirement. An idempotent successful re-init reissues the requirement because it cannot observe session state. In every case, the result is guidance only: it neither proves comprehension nor creates a Work Item, claim, Evidence entry, transition, closeout, approval, or external action.

Use `node ./templew.mjs observe .` when you need the local read-only overview. Use `--no-write --json` when another Agent needs only an ephemeral projection. Evidence capture and Observer usage are documented in [Evidence and Observer](../operations/evidence-and-observer.md).

Token observation is separate and optional. Temple remains fully usable with observation Off; missing usage is reported as unknown, never zero. Use a foreground Codex Provider for a bounded session or explicitly install the clone-local macOS service when continuous per-Work-Item analysis is valuable. Earlier observations remain local after the Provider stops, while work completed outside active correlated observation cannot be backfilled from account totals. See [Usage observation](../operations/usage-observation.md) before enabling it.

### Command notation after init

Run durable project commands from the project root as `node ./templew.mjs <command> .`. Some older examples below retain the shorter `temple` spelling for readability and for contributors who used `npm link`; substitute the repository launcher when copying them into an initialized project. The launcher does not bundle Node.js, Git credentials, or network access. See [Runtime coordination and recovery](../operations/runtime-coordination.md).

If the target already has `AGENTS.md`, Temple leaves it unchanged by default and Doctor reports a pending-integration warning. Add `--integrate-agents` only after confirming that Temple may append its managed block.

### Maintainer-only toolkit self-hosting

Ordinary product repositories must not use this mode. Temple maintainers can initialize the toolkit repository as its own project only after confirming project-specific Agent names and approving the root `AGENTS.md` integration:

```bash
node ./bin/temple.mjs init . \
  --self-host \
  --integrate-agents \
  --config /path/to/confirmed-temple-init.json \
  --dry-run
node ./bin/temple.mjs init . \
  --self-host \
  --integrate-agents \
  --config /path/to/confirmed-temple-init.json
```

The root `.ai-org/` then describes work on Temple itself. `project-overlay/` remains the identity-free distribution source installed into other projects. The self-host lock may adopt only the declared byte-identical bootstrap `$temple-init`; all other untracked managed collisions still stop before writes.

In this maintainer-only mode, `node ./templew.mjs ...` executes the current worktree's own `bin/temple.mjs`. This keeps a detached candidate worktree from silently using another same-version checkout through `npm link` or a global package. The launcher canonicalizes the local path, requires it to remain inside the toolkit worktree, and checks its version before execution. A missing, escaping, or version-mismatched local CLI stops bootstrap instead of falling back. `TEMPLE_CLI_PATH` remains an explicit compatible-version override for diagnostics, but normal self-host work no longer requires it. See [ADR-0030](../adr/0030-self-host-the-toolkit-with-explicit-boundaries.md).

Before exposing a self-host repository or package, select and review its project-owned Evidence Profile, then run `node ./templew.mjs publication audit . --profile public --surface both`. The audit does not change visibility or publish anything. See [Auditable Self-Hosting and Evidence Profiles](../operations/auditable-self-hosting.md).

### Move from Solo to Collaborative

Initialization starts in the backward-compatible Solo profile. When several people will operate their own Agents, register the accountable Human Principals and additional Agent Identities before selecting Collaborative:

```bash
temple collaboration add-principal . --principal-id principal-alice --name "Alice Morgan"
temple collaboration add-agent . --agent-id agent-taylor --name "Taylor Brooks"
temple collaboration sponsor . --principal-id principal-alice --agent-id agent-taylor
temple collaboration add-membership . \
  --agent-id agent-taylor \
  --position developer \
  --discipline backend
temple collaboration qualify-membership . \
  --agent-id agent-taylor \
  --position developer \
  --status active \
  --evidence docs/qualifications/taylor-backend.md \
  --risk-tier standard
temple collaboration set-profile . --profile collaborative
temple collaboration bind-identity . \
  --principal-id principal-alice \
  --verification-class external-evidence \
  --provider-id github \
  --provider-subject 12345678 \
  --evidence-ref github:organization-membership-review
temple collaboration show .
temple doctor .
```

The original Assignment remains the default Position owner. A new non-default membership starts provisional; evidence-backed qualification makes the Agent eligible for bounded claims. It does not replace the default Assignment or create Human Authority. Add more `--discipline` values for a full-stack or cross-specialty Agent. The local actor binding is stored under the Git common directory, never pushed, and contains no credential.

Collaborative Work Item IDs include a date and random suffix so separate clones are unlikely to allocate the same file. This is not distributed locking. Use protected branches, pull requests, CI, and normal Git conflict handling across machines. See the [Collaborative development model](../operations/collaboration.md).

### Move to High-Assurance

High-Assurance is selected for risk, not headcount. First register at least two active Human Principals, sponsor every active Agent Identity, and keep Developer distinct from Independent QA and Release Manager. Then:

```bash
temple collaboration set-profile . --profile high-assurance
temple work-item create . \
  --title "Perform one controlled migration" \
  --scope "One reversible record" \
  --acceptance "Exact-revision test and Independent QA pass" \
  --affected-path src/migration \
  --base-revision HEAD \
  --risk-tier high \
  --ui-mode not-applicable
temple doctor .
```

Every new Work Item receives a `low`, `standard`, `high`, or `critical` risk contract. Later transitions require normalized risk, Git, test, and Independent QA Evidence IDs. Closeout requires revision-matched rollback and a `temple.approval/v1` repository record; it still performs no external action. See [High-Assurance profile](../operations/high-assurance.md).

## 3. Optional Build Quality pack

Core init does not automatically install development Skills. When observable red-green work and bounded bug diagnosis are needed, inspect and preview the pack first:

```bash
temple pack list .
temple pack install . --pack build-quality --dry-run
temple pack install . --pack build-quality
temple doctor .
```

Build Quality provides:

- `$tdd`: For authorized implementation with a stable public seam, preserve red, the minimum implementation, green, and regression evidence.
- `$diagnosing-bugs`: Find the smallest root cause from a reproducible symptom, ranked hypotheses, and discriminating evidence. Diagnosis is read-only by default and modifies the product only when authorized.

Removal can also be previewed:

```bash
temple pack remove . --pack build-quality --dry-run
temple pack remove . --pack build-quality
```

Pack files are checksum-managed. Manifest v2 covers Skill entrypoints plus declared references, scripts, and assets, and records dependencies, provenance, and compatibility in `temple.lock`. If a project modifies one, install, upgrade, or remove stops. Do not bypass the guard by editing `temple.lock` manually.

### Optional Archify adapter

Archify is separate from Skill packs and absent by default. Its installer accepts only an exact local Git checkout; it does not download or execute upstream code:

```bash
temple adapter archify-status .
temple adapter archify-install . --source /absolute/path/to/archify-checkout
temple adapter archify-status . --json
temple doctor .
```

The isolated project-owned copy records pinned source, MIT license, and per-file digests. See [Archify adapter](../extensions/archify-adapter.md).

## 4. Add a project-owned Skill

When a repeated project procedure deserves its own capability, invoke `$skill-authoring` and provide the intended outcome plus the target repository. The Skill first distinguishes a reusable procedure from a Position responsibility, project fact, one-time workaround, or missing deterministic tool.

Project extensions live at collision-free `.agents/skills/<skill-name>/` paths. Before editing, inspect the exact entries in `temple.lock.managed_files`; do not replace a managed Skill or hand-edit the lock. Re-init and upgrade preserve unlisted project files and stop if a future core or pack path collides with one.

The authoring procedure defines the trigger, neighboring non-trigger, authority, dependencies, provenance, completion boundary, scenarios, and validation evidence. It does not authorize dependency installation, publication, external actions, the Skill's target operation, or promotion into core or an official pack. See [Extending a project with Skills](../extensions/skill-authoring.md).

The current alpha does not provide Skill mutation or installation commands, custom-pack publishing, dependency resolution, automated model-routing evaluation, or third-party update management. It does generate a read-only Capability Registry from repository Skills; discovery does not install, approve, or take ownership of a project extension.

## 5. Retrieve and preserve engineering learning

Search `.ai-org/learning/index.json` before repeating similar work. The index contains compact retrieval fields—summary, tags, applicability, status, source work items, validation dates, and the full record path—rather than duplicating the complete evidence. Read only entries relevant to the current Position, work item, and technical area.

When the user or an authorized Work Item asks to preserve learning, use the atomic CLI so the Markdown record, v2 index, and event history stay consistent:

```bash
temple learning add-lesson . \
  --title "Keep runtime evidence revision-specific" \
  --summary "Runtime evidence is trustworthy only with its tested revision." \
  --confidence medium \
  --tag verification \
  --applies-to independent-qa \
  --source-work-item WI-0001

temple learning add-practice . \
  --title "Revision-bound runtime evidence" \
  --summary "Record the exact revision for every runtime claim." \
  --confidence medium \
  --derived-from LESSON-0001 \
  --owner-position tech_lead

temple learning revalidate . \
  --learning-id PRACTICE-0001 \
  --result confirmed \
  --review-after 2026-12-01T00:00:00.000Z

temple learning list . --json
```

Use `learning migrate --dry-run` before explicitly migrating a readable legacy v1 index to v2. Lesson states are `candidate`, `validated`, and `deprecated`; Practice states are `candidate`, `active`, and `deprecated`. Revalidation may confirm, narrow, or contradict existing guidance and can schedule a later review. Status and Observer surface due, overdue, and contradicted entries without changing them automatically.

Promotion remains separate and optional. A Skill is appropriate only for a reusable, non-obvious procedure; use an automated check for a deterministic condition, an ADR for a decision, or an instruction for an explicitly approved recurring rule. The current alpha does not execute automatic retrospectives, promote learning, synchronize projects, or install semantic retrieval. See the [Engineering Learning Loop](../extensions/engineering-learning.md).

## 6. Route bounded context and discover capabilities

Maintain `.ai-org/project/context-map.json` as a thin index of important canonical sources. Store paths, short summaries, tags, relevant Positions, and read conditions; do not copy the full Spec, ADR, or runbook into the map. Active route paths must exist, and `temple doctor` validates them.

Inspect the generated repository capability inventory or search for a relevant method:

```bash
temple capability list .
temple capability find . --query "checkout documentation" --position developer
```

When creating work, record likely write scope and explicitly known context routes:

```bash
temple work-item create . \
  --title "Verify checkout totals" \
  --scope "Checkout calculation and tests" \
  --acceptance "Independent QA reproduces public totals" \
  --affected-path "src/checkout/**" \
  --context-ref checkout-spec
```

Before acting in a Position, preview its bounded Context Capsule:

```bash
temple context resolve . \
  --work-item WI-0001 \
  --position developer \
  --revision abc123 \
  --no-write \
  --json
```

The result routes to matching Context Map entries, active Practices, validated Lessons, and repository Skills. It also reports affected-path overlap with other active work items. Remove `--no-write` to save the generated view under `.ai-org/views/work-items/`; never edit that projection as canonical state.

The selected Retrieval Provider is deterministic, repository-local, and `semantic: false`. Alpha.19 also defines an injectable local-hybrid boundary with provenance and deterministic fallback, but leaves it `available_not_configured`. It does not install or select a model, embedding index, vector database, daemon, or remote search service.

Measure routing with checked-in cases before changing providers:

```bash
temple learning evaluate . \
  --fixture .ai-org/artifacts/retrieval-evaluation.json \
  --no-write \
  --json
temple retrieval show .
```

The result reports hit rate and mean reciprocal rank. Large-repository evaluation remains `not_run`. See [Progressive context routing](../extensions/context-routing.md).

## 7. Register product specifications

Maintain `.ai-org/project/spec-index.json` as a compact project-owned authority registry. The document body may remain in the repository or in an approved external system; the index stores only stable identity, kind, authority, status, revision, source, ownership, approval, and relationships. Choose `federated` when existing external systems remain authoritative, `temple-native` when governed documents live in the repository, or `hybrid` when both are used.

Copy the relevant managed template into a project-owned document location, or register an existing external source. For example:

```json
{
  "id": "FEATURE-CHECKOUT",
  "kind": "feature_spec",
  "title": "Checkout totals",
  "authority": "authoritative_external",
  "status": "approved",
  "revision": "confluence-v12",
  "source": {
    "kind": "external",
    "location": "https://docs.example.com/checkout",
    "system": "confluence",
    "content_sha256": null
  },
  "owner_position": "product_manager",
  "approved_by": "product-owner",
  "approved_at": "2026-08-29T10:00:00Z",
  "approval_ref": "https://docs.example.com/checkout/approvals/12",
  "source_refs": [],
  "related_work_items": [],
  "updated_at": "2026-08-29T10:00:00Z"
}
```

Do not treat a repository summary of an external business document as equal authority. Mark that summary `derived_projection` and pin its `source_refs` to the current authoritative entry revision. Mark uncertain legacy material `legacy_unverified` until its owner resolves it. Approved entries require an attributable actor, ISO UTC approval time, and `approval_ref`. Approved `temple_native` sources also record `content_sha256`; `temple doctor` checks all indexed repository sources, while lifecycle and context commands check the sources referenced by the active Work Item. External systems are not contacted automatically, and the current alpha requires an HTTP(S) URL for an `external` source location.

Pin the exact approved contracts when work is created or configured:

```bash
temple work-item create . \
  --title "Verify checkout totals" \
  --scope "One checkout calculation slice" \
  --acceptance "Independent QA reproduces the approved totals" \
  --spec-mode indexed \
  --spec-ref FEATURE-CHECKOUT@confluence-v12 \
  --contract-ref API-CHECKOUT@openapi-v4 \
  --ui-mode code-first
```

Use repeatable `--spec-ref`, `--ux-ref`, `--ui-ref`, and `--contract-ref` values. Configure updates matching IDs and preserves sibling references. Use `--replace-spec-refs`, `--replace-ux-refs`, `--replace-ui-refs`, or `--replace-contract-refs` only when intentionally replacing or clearing that complete category. Temple requires supplied references to be approved and current at their lifecycle boundaries; a changed, superseded, or content-drifted source blocks later delivery until it is reconciled and intentionally repinned. `contract_refs` are governed API or technical-design entries. Collaborative `shared_contract_refs` are coordination paths or surfaces and do not replace the governed reference.

Governance cannot be weakened in place after delivery begins. At Design, the specification mode and `spec_refs` IDs are fixed; at Build, the UI delivery mode and `ux_refs`, `ui_refs`, and `contract_refs` IDs are also fixed. `work-item configure` may repin the same ID only to its current approved revision. Stop and replan the Work Item before changing its governing contract identity or delivery mode.

Without `--spec-ref`, a new Work Item records `specification_mode: gate-evidence`. That lightweight path still requires named approved-scope and acceptance evidence at the Spec gate, but it does not claim index-based product-scope revision protection. Supporting indexed UX, UI, API, or technical contracts may still be attached and enforced. Use it deliberately for bounded low-risk or migrate-on-touch work; use `--spec-mode indexed` with at least one approved `--spec-ref` for maintained, multi-party, or long-lived product behavior.

For existing organizations, preserve trusted documents first and migrate only when ownership, consumers, and acceptance are clear. See [Product specification system](../concepts/product-specifications.md) and [Enterprise document adoption](enterprise-document-adoption.md).

## 8. Create a work item

Choose the workflow profile before execution. The example below is a bounded Lean change; use Standard for ordinary delivery or required Independent QA, and High-Assurance for production, security, sensitive-data, destructive, or difficult-to-reverse work.

```bash
node ./templew.mjs work-item create . \
  --title "Correct the checkout total" \
  --scope "Checkout calculation and focused tests" \
  --scope "No deployment or external release" \
  --acceptance "The reproduced total is correct and existing tests pass" \
  --affected-path "src/checkout/**" \
  --affected-path "test/checkout/**" \
  --workflow-profile lean \
  --risk-tier low \
  --scope-class bounded \
  --profile-rationale "Local reversible change with stable acceptance" \
  --ui-mode not-applicable
```

Temple allocates the next `WI-####`, resolves the current owner Position and Agent, appends an event, rebuilds status, and outputs a suggested Codex task title, for example:

```text
WI-0002 · Ship checkout · Engineering Manager (Clara)
```

The title is only a readable projection. The work item ID and subsequently registered thread ID are the actual identifiers.

For ordinary bounded work, Temple uses `WI-#### · short goal · Position (Agent)`. The short goal comes from the Work Item title; Temple shortens only that segment so the complete suggestion stays within 58 Unicode code points and keeps the Position and Agent visible on the verified Codex navigation surface. A long-lived project control task is different: name it `Project · control scope · Primary Position (Agent)`, for example `Temple · Control and Roadmap · Engineering Manager (Mog)`. Do not register that control conversation against a fabricated Work Item.

If an existing task registry still contains older suggestions, refresh them explicitly:

```bash
temple task refresh-titles .
temple task list .
```

This changes only repository-stored suggestions. It preserves thread IDs, task status, model and revision evidence, claims, workers, and archive state, and it does not rename a task in the Codex app. Rename the visible task separately through the app, then verify the displayed result.

In Collaborative mode the printed ID instead resembles `WI-20260829-A1B2C3D4E5`. Do not predict it; use the value returned by `work-item create`.

### Claim ordinary sequential work

After the Work Item reaches the stage owned by the assigned Agent, claim active responsibility using the current revision and branch:

```bash
git rev-parse HEAD
git branch --show-current

node ./templew.mjs work-item claim . \
  --work-item WI-0002 \
  --agent-id agent-taylor \
  --principal-id human \
  --base-revision abc123 \
  --branch feature/checkout-total
```

Record the handoff before leaving the stage, then release the claim:

```bash
node ./templew.mjs work-item release . \
  --work-item WI-0002 \
  --agent-id agent-taylor \
  --principal-id human \
  --reason "Handoff recorded"
```

Assignment identifies the responsible Agent; an active claim identifies who is executing now. Releasing a claim changes neither the Assignment nor the retained Work Item history.

### Resolve method, context, and execution advice

Immediately before scoped execution, discover a relevant Capability, preview the bounded Context Capsule, and—when the project uses Adaptive Execution Routing—resolve the current step:

```bash
node ./templew.mjs capability find . \
  --query "checkout calculation" \
  --position developer

node ./templew.mjs context resolve . \
  --work-item WI-0002 \
  --position developer \
  --revision abc123 \
  --no-write \
  --json

node ./templew.mjs execution resolve . \
  --request .ai-org/evaluations/execution/WI-0002-build.json \
  --json
```

The Execution Route is a read-only recommendation. It does not start a Provider, apply a model, change a claim, or satisfy a lifecycle gate. See [Execution routing operations](../operations/execution-routing.md) for the request format and interpretation rules.

For parallel candidates, record the coordination contract and inspect every readiness check before runtime preparation. Stage requirements replace the legacy Discipline only at the named lifecycle stage. Define a shared resource first when work needs scarce local or remote capacity:

```bash
node ./templew.mjs resource define . \
  --resource-id ios-simulator \
  --name "iOS Simulator" \
  --capacity 1

temple work-item configure . \
  --work-item WI-20260829-A1B2C3D4E5 \
  --parent WI-20260829-1111111111 \
  --depends-on WI-20260829-2222222222 \
  --agent-id agent-taylor \
  --discipline backend \
  --stage-discipline test=quality \
  --stage-resource test=ios-simulator \
  --base-revision abc123 \
  --integration-owner agent-taylor \
  --shared-contract-ref docs/checkout-api.md \
  --contract-status stable \
  --parallel-mode parallel

temple parallel check . --work-item WI-20260829-A1B2C3D4E5

temple parallel plan . \
  --parent WI-20260829-1111111111 \
  --max-workers 3

node ./templew.mjs parallel prepare . \
  --work-item WI-20260829-A1B2C3D4E5 \
  --agent-id agent-taylor \
  --principal-id principal-alice \
  --base-revision abc123 \
  --branch alice/checkout-totals \
  --worktree /absolute/path/to/worktree \
  --runtime-kind user-task
```

The example IDs and revision are placeholders. Complete the normal lifecycle gates until the Work Item's owner Position matches the planned Agent's membership; Developer preparation therefore occurs after transition to Build. `work-item configure --parallel-mode parallel` is rejected unless scope, acceptance, ownership, base revision, affected paths, dependencies, shared-contract state, overlaps, integration ownership, unresolved items, active-stage Discipline eligibility, and shared-resource availability all pass. An overlap resolution must name the exact conflicting Work Item ID.

`parallel plan` recursively selects the named parent's non-terminal descendants, places selected dependencies in later waves, keeps unresolved path or shared-resource-capacity conflicts out of the same wave, and limits each wave when `--max-workers` is present. Without `--parent` it evaluates every active Work Item; without `--max-workers` it leaves undeclared runtime capacity to the runtime. Add `--no-write` for a read-only preview. The resulting `.ai-org/views/parallel-plan.json` is generated and source-fingerprinted. Planning creates no task or claim.

When implementation is already authorized, call `parallel prepare` for each worker in the stored first wave before creating it. Preparation atomically records its eligible claim, resource reservations, and runtime-worker reservation. Attach an internal subagent with `worker attach --runtime-id`; attach a separate user-owned Codex task with `task register --worker-id`. If the runtime cannot dispatch concurrently, preserve the wave and execute prepared work sequentially. The Integration Owner joins exact revisions, verification, and unresolved items, then rebuilds the plan before dependent work. A terminal worker releases resources but does not advance the lifecycle or release an attached claim; use `work-item release` at handoff, abandonment, or completion. See [Parallel orchestration](../operations/parallel-orchestration.md) and [Runtime coordination and recovery](../operations/runtime-coordination.md).

### Select UI design depth

Select one explicit Work Item value:

- `not-applicable`: no user-facing interface changes; do not attach `ui_refs`.
- `code-first`: no separate pre-implementation mockup; retain the brief, required-state coverage, and runtime visual review.
- `preview-first`: review a wireframe, code preview, prototype, partial Figma design, or equivalent artifact before full implementation.
- `design-led`: use an approved, versioned design source and implementation mapping.

For interface work, copy `.ai-org/templates/ui-design-brief.md` into a project-owned artifact location and record its rationale and evidence. Choose the lightest tool that satisfies the mode. Figma is optional. Preview-first and design-led require an approved `ui_ref`; any `ui_ref` requires an explicit mode. Code-first may begin without a UI source, but it still requires state coverage and runtime visual review. Record the mode-specific evidence with named `--satisfy` values: prebuild evidence is enforced before Build, and all `minimum_evidence` from `.ai-org/core/ui-design.json` is enforced before a `go` closeout. See [UI design responsibility and delivery modes](../concepts/ui-design.md) and [UI interaction contracts](../concepts/ui-interaction-contracts.md).

### Manage unresolved items

List unresolved items without changing canonical state:

```bash
temple work-item unresolved . --work-item WI-0002
```

Resolve an exact existing entry, add or merge a new entry, or do both atomically:

```bash
temple work-item unresolved . \
  --work-item WI-0002 \
  --resolve "API contract needs review" \
  --merge "Physical-device coverage remains pending"
```

Resolution uses exact normalized text and rejects a missing entry before writing. Repeated `--merge` values are deduplicated. The same text cannot be resolved and merged in one command.

### Pilot or example work item

If a work item exists only to validate the framework, workflow, architecture, or technical feasibility, its scope and acceptance criteria must also state:

- Experiment purpose: what this run must prove.
- Stop condition: which evidence means work should stop.
- Excluded follow-on work: which new features, second work item, distribution, or productization are not authorized.

A release-gate `go` accepts only the bounded experiment. After the stop condition is met, freeze the sample, write a retrospective, and return control to the Engineering Manager and user. Do not continue product development without a new explicit request. See [ADR-0011](../adr/0011-pilot-stop-boundary.md).

## 9. Coordinate with an external tracker

Keep the company tracker, repository Work Items, and Codex tasks as separate layers. Configure no provider for repository-only work. When the company uses GitHub Issues:

```bash
temple tracker configure . \
  --tracker-profile linked-tracker \
  --sync-granularity team-visible \
  --provider-id github-main \
  --provider-kind github \
  --project owner/repository \
  --write-policy plan-only

temple tracker link . \
  --work-item WI-0001 \
  --provider-id github-main \
  --item-id 381 \
  --url https://github.com/owner/repository/issues/381

temple tracker inspect . --work-item WI-0001 --no-write --json
temple tracker plan . --work-item WI-0001 --no-write --json
```

Root Work Items default to `team-visible`; children default to `internal`. Keep AI-only implementation and verification slices internal unless another person or team must coordinate them. Jira and generic providers currently accept a normalized observation file rather than contacting the service directly:

```bash
temple tracker reconcile . \
  --work-item WI-0001 \
  --observation /absolute/path/to/observation.json \
  --resolution keep-temple \
  --reason "Repository lifecycle evidence remains incomplete"
```

The command records repository evidence and never writes externally. External completion cannot satisfy Temple lifecycle gates. See [Task and external tracker coordination](../operations/task-and-tracker-coordination.md) for profiles, field ownership, manual observation format, and company-team responsibilities.

## 10. Register a Codex task

The Temple CLI does not directly create Codex app tasks. After the user or Codex app creates a separate user-owned task, register its actual ID. If it was prepared from a parallel wave, pass the reserved worker ID:

```bash
temple task register . \
  --work-item WI-0002 \
  --position developer \
  --thread-id 01example \
  --worker-id worker-example \
  --host-id local \
  --revision abc123
```

Omit `--worker-id` only for a task that was not created through the parallel-preparation protocol. Internal subagents use `worker attach` and must never be added to `.ai-org/project/tasks.json`. By default, `task register` attributes the registration action to the Engineering Manager. Use `--actor` to specify an Agent who holds that Position or `human`. By default, `task update` is performed by the task's Agent; the Engineering Manager and `human` may also update registry metadata. The task owner and the actor who performs registration are stored separately.

Update progress:

```bash
temple task update . --task-id task-0001 --status waiting --revision def456
temple task update . --task-id task-0001 --status completed --revision fedcba
temple task list .
```

Valid states are `setup`, `active`, `waiting`, `attention`, `completed`, and `archived`. When the work item is terminal and the task is completed, status reports archive-ready. Actual archiving still requires an explicit Codex app operation.

## 11. Handoff and transition

A handoff records a caller-supplied revision reference, completed work, evidence, and unresolved issues:

```bash
temple handoff . \
  --work-item WI-0002 \
  --to quality_evaluator \
  --input-revision fedcba \
  --completed "Implemented the accepted scope" \
  --evidence .ai-org/artifacts/WI-0002/developer-tests.md \
  --unresolved "Physical device remains out of scope"
```

A transition allows only edges defined in `.ai-org/core/workflow.json`. Every `requires` entry must be satisfied with a named evidence reference:

```bash
temple transition . \
  --work-item WI-0002 \
  --to design \
  --satisfy approved_scope=docs/spec.md \
  --satisfy acceptance_criteria=docs/spec.md
```

The CLI rejects the operation before writing if a requirement is missing, a state is skipped, or the actor does not hold the current Position. Evidence adapters resolve Git observations to exact commits. High-Assurance additionally resolves handoff and closeout refs and requires normalized Evidence IDs at its specified transitions; Solo and Collaborative may still preserve caller-supplied revision references where exact resolution is not a declared gate.

## 12. Release gate and closeout

`temple close` completes only organizational closeout. It does not deploy, publish, send external messages, or obtain high-risk approval:

```bash
temple close . \
  --work-item WI-0002 \
  --decision go \
  --tested-revision fedcba \
  --approval not-required \
  --rollback "Use git revert for the bounded candidate" \
  --satisfy accepted_scope=docs/spec.md \
  --satisfy test_evidence=.ai-org/artifacts/WI-0002/test.md \
  --satisfy evaluation_report=.ai-org/artifacts/WI-0002/evaluation.md \
  --satisfy independent_qa_report=.ai-org/artifacts/WI-0002/independent-qa.md
```

Use `--approval not-required` only when policies contain no production-change, external-message, irreversible-action, material-cost, or sensitive-data trigger. Otherwise, reference a human approval record.

High-Assurance never accepts `not-required`. Use a valid repository `temple.approval/v1` record bound to the exact tested commit, and pass normalized rollback Evidence IDs instead of prose. High and critical tiers also enforce their approval count and rollback depth. See [High-Assurance profile](../operations/high-assurance.md).

`--decision no-go` requires at least one `--reason` and closes the approved attempt in terminal state `concluded`, owned by the Engineering Manager, with lifecycle outcome `no-go` or an explicitly supplied `inconclusive`. It does not imply continuation. Use `blocked` only when unfinished work can resume after a named impediment is resolved.

## 13. Observation and health checks

```bash
temple status .
temple status . --json --no-write
temple doctor .
```

Start or inspect the local replay-safe control plane:

```bash
temple control-plane snapshot . --json
temple control-plane start .
temple control-plane start . --codex
temple control-plane capture-github . \
  --provider-id github-pr-42 \
  --work-item WI-0001 \
  --revision 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567
```

Alpha.22 adds three visibly separate Human Inbox queues for live runtime permissions, local business-fact proposals, and revision-bound governance approvals. Only the still-live provider can receive a runtime answer; a business response requires a second explicit incorporation step before it becomes a canonical context reference; governance records enforce current Work Item state, exact revision, active Human Principals, approval counts, and High-Assurance separation. The loopback gateway requires a per-process session secret, same-origin request, matching idempotency key, and bounded JSON body.

The GitHub PR and Checks provider is opt-in, read-only, exact-SHA-bound, and configured in `.ai-org/project/control-plane.json`. It stores only the environment-variable name for its token. A reviewed local observation enters the Evidence Registry only through `capture-github`; capture does not add gate evidence or advance the Work Item. The telemetry journal remains generated below the Git common directory, shared by linked worktrees in one clone, redacted by default, and incapable of satisfying a lifecycle gate. See the [local control-plane guide](../operations/control-plane.md).

Evaluate adversarial policy observations without changing lifecycle state:

```bash
node ./templew.mjs evaluation run . \
  --fixture .ai-org/artifacts/policy-evaluation/solo.json \
  --no-write \
  --json
```

Check whether the current task topology and Provider can produce a project-attributed usage baseline:

```bash
node ./templew.mjs usage preflight . --json
```

Optionally probe only whether Codex account activity metadata is available:

```bash
node ./templew.mjs usage preflight . --probe-codex-account --json
```

The optional probe is account-wide and unallocated. It does not output account Token totals, invoke a model, qualify the project baseline, or assign activity to a Work Item. Detailed attribution still requires a registered live task and provider-emitted thread usage.

Inspect the provider-reported usage baseline without writing a generated view:

```bash
node ./templew.mjs usage report . --no-write --json
```

The policy fixture begins at `.ai-org/templates/policy-evaluation-fixture.json`. `unknown` and missing scenarios do not pass. Usage aggregation sums provider last-usage deltas and keeps unavailable dimensions and monetary cost unknown; it does not call another model, recommend a model, switch providers, or let a budget bypass evidence. A completed task or a task attached to a terminal Work Item can be reconciled from bounded history but is never resumed as a live usage subscription; an archived task remains detached. See [Adversarial policy evaluation](../operations/policy-evaluation.md) and [Token Efficiency and Model Routing](../operations/token-efficiency-and-model-routing.md).

`status.md` includes:

- Work-item state, owner, Agent, latest revision, evidence, and unresolved issues.
- Codex tasks and threads, suggested titles, status, revision, and archive readiness.
- Context Map route counts, selected provider mode, local-hybrid boundary, retrieval evaluation state, and Capability Registry counts.
- Product-specification authority, approval, and source counts plus stale Work Item references.
- Engineering Learning Loop counts, revalidation-due and contradicted signals, and the retrieval-index path.
- High-Assurance Work Item risk contracts and optional Archify adapter status.
- Blocked, attention, and archive-ready signals.
- The eight most recent canonical events.
- Position Assignments and optional-integration states.

## 14. Back up and recover Temple project state

Create a verified backup outside the repository before a risky framework or project-state change:

```bash
node ./templew.mjs backup create . --output /absolute/recovery/location/project-backup
node ./templew.mjs backup inspect . --backup /absolute/recovery/location/project-backup
node ./templew.mjs restore preview . --backup /absolute/recovery/location/project-backup
```

Restore requires the exact preview digest and explicit `--allow-replace` consent whenever existing files would change. Target-only files are preserved; application source, managed framework files, generated views, external systems, and application data are not in this backup. See [Backup and recovery](../operations/backup-and-recovery.md) before relying on it.

## 15. Upgrade from an older version

```bash
temple upgrade /absolute/path/to/project --dry-run
temple migration plan /absolute/path/to/project --json
temple upgrade /absolute/path/to/project
temple schema validate /absolute/path/to/project --json
temple doctor /absolute/path/to/project
temple status /absolute/path/to/project
```

Upgrade rules:

- Validate every managed checksum against the old `temple.lock` first.
- Update only managed files that the project has not modified.
- A proposed new managed path must not already exist unless its exact path is already managed by the installed lock; byte-identical untracked files are not silently adopted.
- Preserve installed optional packs and update them to the current pack version. Upgrade does not enable an uninstalled pack automatically.
- Validate Pack v2 provenance, compatibility, dependencies, and every declared Skill, reference, script, and asset path.
- Preserve `.ai-org/project/**`, `.ai-org/learning/**`, work items, events, decisions, artifacts, Agent names, and product files. If an older installation has no specification index, learning index, or Context Map, upgrade creates only the corresponding empty project-owned seed.
- Preserve an existing UI Designer Assignment. If an older project has none, assign UI Designer to its single active UX Designer Agent Identity; ambiguous Assignment state stops the migration.
- Record applied entries from the managed migration registry. Existing project-owned Learning v1 remains readable and changes only through explicit `learning migrate`; missing empty v2 seeds may be created automatically.
- Detected preflight conflicts stop before writing. Late file races trigger a rollback journal; if another writer changes a just-written path again, the CLI preserves that content and reports incomplete rollback for manual review.

## 16. Use Decision, Domain, Documentation, Authoring, and Development Skills

- `$decision-interview`: Break an ambiguous idea into known facts, options, decisions, and unknowns. If repository documents, code, or Git state constrain the choice, the same Skill switches to evidence-backed mode and cites actual paths.
- `$domain-modeling`: Organize ubiquitous language, bounded contexts, rules, and invariants, then preserve confirmed terms in the project-owned glossary.
- `$project-documentation`: Create or update human-facing README, setup, usage, contribution, and documentation-index files from repository evidence. It checks commands, links, shipped claims, audience, and language policy without taking over Agent instructions or product specifications.
- `$skill-authoring`: Create, revise, or audit a repository-local reusable procedure with explicit routing, authority, dependencies, provenance, validation, and completion. It keeps project extensions project-owned and does not silently promote or distribute them.

Each Skill preserves the request's authority boundary. Inspection, classification, and proposals are read-only by default; a Skill may change only its declared target artifacts when the user or current work item explicitly authorizes that mutation. Otherwise, show the proposed target and contents. Selecting a Skill never authorizes unrelated implementation or external action.

`$tdd` and `$diagnosing-bugs` are available only when the Build Quality pack is installed. They improve development procedure but do not replace Positions, work-item gates, release authority, or Independent QA.

## 17. Troubleshooting

- `managed file changed`: Inspect the diff first. Do not bypass it by re-running init or editing the lock. A locked file cannot become a project extension merely by modifying it; restore or rename it through an explicit migration, or contribute the change back to the central framework.
- `missing gate evidence`: Add real evidence, then use `--satisfy requirement=reference`. Do not enter a fabricated path.
- `actor does not hold Position`: Return to Assignments and use the correct Agent and Position, or record an explicit human action.
- `agents_md_pending_merge`: Inspect `.ai-org/project/AGENTS.temple.md`, then obtain human approval for integration.
- `developer_qa_not_independent`: Change the Assignment so Developer and Independent QA use different `agent_id` values.
- `task registry` error: Confirm that the work item, Position, Agent, thread ID, and status all exist and are unique.
- `untracked file blocks optional pack`: The target Skill path already contains different content. Confirm ownership and provenance; do not let the pack overwrite it.
- `installed pack file changed`: Inspect the Skill diff. To retain custom content, do not remove or upgrade it. To return to the central version, explicitly resolve the difference first.
- `engineering_learning` error: Keep each Lesson or Practice path, ID, status, and index entry consistent; remove neither side without updating the other.
- `context_map` error: Correct unsafe or missing active route paths, unknown Positions, or malformed route metadata in `.ai-org/project/context-map.json`.
- `spec_index` error: Correct malformed IDs, authority/source mismatches, missing approval evidence, unsafe repository paths, or invalid source references in `.ai-org/project/spec-index.json`.
- Stale specification warning: Reconcile the governing document change, then intentionally repin the Work Item to the approved current revision; do not edit the revision merely to silence the warning.
- `capability_registry` error: Repair the named repository `SKILL.md` frontmatter or align its `name` with the containing directory. Do not add a project Skill to `temple.lock` merely to silence the error.
- Affected-path overlap warning: Coordinate the two non-terminal work items before editing shared paths. The warning is not an automatic cancellation or ownership transfer.
