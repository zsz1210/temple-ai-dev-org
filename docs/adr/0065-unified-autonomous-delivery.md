# ADR-0065: Shared autonomous execution with preserved risk contracts

Status: accepted for implementation under WI-0282 by the maintainer.

Extend the opt-in daily execution entry with a versioned plan for all existing
workflow profiles. Preserve the default and historical Lean delivery contract.
Approved scope, acceptance, design constraints and risk requirements precede Build.
The Developer chooses methods; an independent eligible reviewer supplies substantive
verification. Lifecycle stages remain durable evidence obligations, not instructions
to call a model once per stage. Reuse real evidence across matching responsibilities.

Reuse the exact-revision completion journal, claim release, existing transition and
closeout validators, and post-write diagnostics. Do not create a second lifecycle.
Standard and High-Assurance retain their named gates and Principal requirements.
Changing a profile, scope, authority or candidate invalidates automatic continuation.
Each completion request identifies its originating stage, actor and exact evidence.
Return the next owner without requiring another human approval for already authorized
local work. Reviewer repair uses existing same-scope rework and reserved capacity.

An optional confined-node check runs under a platform-enforced local restriction,
with no network, no subprocess forks, read-only source and only temporary writes.
It is suitable for compatible Node tests, not arbitrary build systems. Unsupported
platforms reject this policy; never silently fall back to host permissions. Legacy
trusted-local checks retain their honest boundary. Neither policy restricts an
unrestricted parent conversation or grants external-action authority.

Organizational acceptance ends at Done. An actual deployment or external action still
requires its separately authorized environment adapter, candidate/authority checks,
post-action validation and recovery. This candidate does not add a deployment adapter
or claim real multi-human validation from synthetic High-Assurance fixtures.

Keep context retrieval demand-driven and learning optional. Fixed administration and
reports call no model. Budget admission preserves repair, verification and cleanup;
unknown provider coverage remains unknown. Validate compatibility and negative controls
before one frozen local comparison; a small result is diagnostic only.
