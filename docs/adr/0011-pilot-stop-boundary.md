# ADR-0011: Stop by default when a pilot is complete

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-08-29

## Context

The FlowDeck greenfield pilot was intended to verify that Temple could turn an ambiguous idea into a new repository, establish product and technical baselines, and take the first work item through the complete lifecycle. Once the callback, tests, exact-revision QA, and closeout all succeeded, the experiment had achieved its purpose. The conversation nevertheless continued treating the sample app as a product that needed further development, misreading "release gate passed" as "continue to the next phase."

This scope drift wastes time and may also make users believe that Temple automatically gained authority to create a new work item, expand the product roadmap, or prepare a release.

## Decision

When a work item is defined as a pilot, example, proof, or template validation:

- The specification must state the experiment purpose, observable stop condition, and excluded follow-on work.
- A release-gate `go` accepts only the bounded experiment; it does not authorize the next product work item.
- After the stop condition is met, the default action is to freeze the sample, return control to the Engineering Manager and user, and write a retrospective.
- New features, a second work item, distribution, or promotion of the sample into a formal product all require a new explicit request.
- The toolkit may preserve anonymized lessons or lessons without private product content, but must not copy code or data from a private pilot repository into the open-source toolkit.

This rule belongs in the project operating contract and shared instructions. The CLI or status output may add a pilot projection later, but that is not a prerequisite for this decision to take effect.

## Consequences

- Completing the lifecycle no longer grants authority for unlimited product expansion.
- Pilot closeout has a clear stop point and retrospective opportunity.
- A user who wants to turn the sample into a product must explicitly define the new goal and risk boundary.
- A greenfield pilot can validate Temple successfully while remaining disposable, private, and non-production.
