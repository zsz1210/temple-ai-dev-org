# Domain Modeling

Build a shared language that product decisions, code, tests, and Agent handoffs can use without guessing.

## Evidence first

1. Read the smallest authoritative set: Project Charter, glossary, relevant decisions, specifications, implementation, tests, and current assignments.
2. Separate observed terms, confirmed definitions, assumptions, conflicts, and missing owners.
3. Do not treat a frequently used term as confirmed when sources disagree.

## Challenge each important term

For every term that changes behavior, establish:

- a concise definition in this project's context;
- examples and non-examples;
- rules or invariants that must remain true;
- its owner or authoritative source;
- how it differs from nearby or legacy terms;
- the bounded context where the definition applies.

Use established Domain-Driven Design constructs only when they clarify the model. Do not force labels such as Entity, Value Object, Aggregate, Domain Event, or Bounded Context without supporting behavior and evidence.

## Persist the result

- Record confirmed vocabulary in `.ai-org/project/domain-glossary.md`, using `.ai-org/templates/domain-glossary.md` when the file does not exist.
- Record long-lived architectural consequences as an ADR under `.ai-org/decisions/`.
- Identify affected specifications, interfaces, migrations, code names, and tests. Do not mark those updates complete until changed and verified.
- Preserve unresolved conflicts with an owner and a decision trigger; do not silently choose a meaning.

Do not implement a refactor unless the user explicitly requests implementation.

Finish when confirmed vocabulary, unresolved conflicts, owners, and downstream impacts are visible in repository files.
